Result: Calls web_research skill, returns findings
Time: <1 second
```

### Multi-Step Workflows (With Dependencies)
```
Step 1: Research topic (web_research)
Step 2: Summarize findings (summarizer) - waits for Step 1
Step 3: Generate report (report_writer) - waits for Step 2
Time: 2-4 seconds total
```

### Real-Time Streaming
```
User sends request
Results stream via Server-Sent Events
Chat UI updates in real-time
User sees progress as steps complete
```

### Advanced Features
- ✅ Retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ TTL-based result caching
- ✅ Parallel skill execution
- ✅ Per-step timeouts
- ✅ Global workflow timeout
- ✅ Error aggregation
- ✅ Performance metrics
