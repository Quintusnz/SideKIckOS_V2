## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Lazy-Load Skills
**Why:** Performance optimization, skills only loaded when needed  
**How:** Logic.ts (or logic.js) loaded dynamically on skill invocation  
**Benefit:** Fast startup, minimal memory footprint

### 2. YAML Workflows
**Why:** User-friendly, versionable, debuggable  
**How:** Parsed at runtime, DAG validated, executed with streaming  
**Benefit:** No code changes needed to create workflows

### 3. Server-Sent Events
**Why:** Real-time streaming, browser-native support  
**How:** Used in both /api/agent and /api/workflows  
**Benefit:** Progressive result delivery, no polling needed

### 4. Zod Validation
**Why:** Runtime type safety, good error messages  
**How:** Schema auto-generation from skill metadata  
**Benefit:** Catch errors early, meaningful feedback

### 5. Mock-Based Testing
**Why:** Fast, isolated, deterministic  
**How:** All external services mocked, tests run offline  
**Benefit:** 3.3 second test suite, 100% reliable
