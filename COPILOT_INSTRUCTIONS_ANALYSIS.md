# Copilot Instructions - Analysis & Creation Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**File Created:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (472 lines)

---

## üìä Analysis Results

### Existing AI Guidelines Found
- ‚úÖ **Analyzed:** Entire SkillsFlow AI codebase
- ‚úÖ **No existing files:** No `.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT.md` found
- ‚úÖ **Documentation-driven:** All architectural patterns documented in 11+ markdown files

### Key Findings

#### 1. **Big Picture Architecture**
The project implements a **chat-based AI orchestrator** with three critical subsystems:
- **Skill Registry:** Dynamic discovery of reusable AI capabilities
- **Skills Orchestrator:** GPT-5 with dynamic tool registration
- **Workflow Engine:** DAG-based multi-step execution

#### 2. **Critical Design Pattern: Lazy-Loading**
Skills are discovered at startup but only executed when invoked - this is crucial for performance and extensibility.

#### 3. **Mandatory Frontend Pattern**
**@ai-sdk/react with useChat() hook is NON-NEGOTIABLE** - this appears in every documentation file with ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê emphasis

#### 4. **Streaming-First Architecture**
All responses use Server-Sent Events (SSE) - not WebSockets or other protocols

#### 5. **Metadata-Driven Design**
Skills use YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md files - this enables AI agents to understand skill capabilities without loading executable code

## üéØ Critical Information Captured

### ‚úÖ Architecture Decisions Documented
1. **Skill Registry as Metadata Registry** - Only YAML frontmatter loaded at startup, logic lazy-loaded
2. **Dynamic Tool Registration** - Skills converted to Vercel AI SDK `tool()` definitions at runtime
3. **Streaming-First** - All responses use `.toTextStreamResponse()` for real-time updates
4. **@ai-sdk/react Mandatory** - Frontend MUST use useChat() hook, no exceptions

### ‚úÖ Common Patterns Documented
1. Parsing SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter extraction
2. Lazy-loading skill logic only when invoked
3. Converting skills to AI SDK tools dynamically
4. Building system prompts with available skills

### ‚úÖ Anti-Patterns Documented
1. ‚ùå Hardcoding skills (use dynamic registry)
2. ‚ùå Loading all skill logic at startup (use lazy-loading)
3. ‚ùå Manual chat state management (use useChat hook)
4. ‚ùå Forgetting timeouts in workflows (always set timeouts)

### ‚úÖ Project-Specific Conventions
1. **TypeScript Mandatory** - All src/ code must be TypeScript
2. **File Naming:** camelCase.ts for utilities, PascalCase.tsx for components
3. **Class Names:** PascalCase (SkillRegistry, SkillsOrchestrator)
4. **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
5. **Interfaces:** PascalCase for contracts (SkillMetadata, Message)

### ‚úÖ Environment Setup
- OPENAI_API_KEY (required)
- AI_MODEL (optional, configurable)
- SKILL_REGISTRY_DIR (optional)
- LOG_LEVEL (optional)

## üöÄ How This Helps AI Agents

### Immediate Productivity
1. **Architecture Understanding:** Core flow from message to response explained in one diagram
2. **File Locations:** Know exactly where each component goes (Phase 1-3 clarity)
3. **Streaming Pattern:** Clear explanation of SSE, streaming backend, and useChat hook
4. **Frontend Rule:** One critical rule prevents the most common mistakes

### Development Decisions
1. **5 Key Questions:** When building something new, ask these first
2. **Development Phases:** Understand milestone 1 (chat UI) vs milestone 2 (orchestration)
3. **Conventions:** Avoid style mismatches and naming inconsistencies

### Error Prevention
1. **Anti-Patterns:** Know what NOT to do (4 critical mistakes documented)
2. **Checklist:** Pre-submission verification prevents common issues
3. **Lazy-Loading Pattern:** Performance implications explained with code examples

## üìö How This Complements Existing Docs

| Copilot Instructions | Existing Docs | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Big Picture | IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md | Summary vs. comprehensive |
| Architecture | VISUAL_REFERENCE.md | Text explanation vs. ASCII diagrams |
| Frontend Pattern | VERCEL_AI_SDK_UI_GUIDE.md | Quick reference vs. 14-page guide |
| Patterns | TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md | Selective examples vs. 25+ examples |
| Anti-Patterns | CLARIFICATIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md | Warnings vs. decision rationale |
| Development Phases | README.md | Quick view vs. full timeline |

**The Copilot instructions are the "quick reference for agents" while docs are the "deep dive for humans"**

## üí° What Makes These Instructions Effective

### 1. **Specific to THIS Project**
- Not generic advice ("write tests")
- Uses exact filenames (`src/lib/skills.ts`)
- References actual patterns from the codebase (SKILL.md structure, YAML frontmatter)

### 2. **Actionable for AI Agents**
- Clear folder structure with relative paths
- Code examples show the correct pattern (useChat, streamText, tool)
- Anti-patterns show exactly what NOT to do

### 3. **Architecture-Aware**
- Explains the "why" behind decisions (lazy-loading for performance)
- Shows data flow from client to backend to AI
- Documents three interconnected systems

### 4. **Decision-Making Framework**
- 5 key questions help agents decide where to put new code
- 4-phase timeline provides milestone context
- Conventions prevent style mismatches
