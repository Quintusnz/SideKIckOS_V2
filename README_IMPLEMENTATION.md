## 🏃 Getting Started (Next 24 Hours)

### Step 1: Review & Align (30 min)
- Read the **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**
- Review **CLARIFICATIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md**
- Answer any of the 18 clarification questions
- Confirm recommendations align with your vision

### Step 2: Environment Setup (1 hour)
```bash
# Create new Next.js 15 project
npx create-next-app@latest skillsflow-ai --typescript --tailwind --shadcn

# Navigate to project
cd skillsflow-ai

# Install additional dependencies
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai zustand framer-motion react-markdown yaml

# Create folder structure
mkdir -p src/lib src/app/api src/app/components
mkdir -p skills workflows
```

### Step 3: Create First Skill (1 hour)
Create `/skills/research/SKILL.md` as your first test skill to validate the system.

### Step 4: Begin Phase 1 Development (Weeks 1-2)
Focus on:
1. Chat interface component
2. Skill registry loader
3. Basic API route
4. 2-3 test skills

## 🗂️ Document Organization

All documents are created in: `c:\vscode\SkillsFlow AI\`

```
SkillsFlow AI/
├── Docs/
│   └── SkillsFlow AI PRD
├── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md          ← Main blueprint
├── TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md          ← Developer guide
├── CLARIFICATIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md ← Decision log
└── (future project files)
```

---

## 🔑 Key Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Layer
```
Next.js App Router (Server Components by default)
  ├── Chat UI (useChat hook from @ai-sdk/react)
  ├── Skill Sidebar (real-time skill list)
  ├── Execution Timeline (step-by-step progress)
  └── Output Renderer (Markdown → Rich UI)
```

### Backend Layer
```
Vercel Edge Runtime (Serverless)
  ├── POST /api/agent → Orchestrator
  ├── GET /api/skills → Registry
  └── GET /api/workflows → Engine
```

### AI Orchestration
```
GPT-5 (Configurable Model)
  + Dynamic Tool Registration (from skills)
  + Multi-step Reasoning
  + Tool Calling Loop
  = Smart Skill Selection & Execution
```

## 💡 Key Innovation Points

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Skill metadata loaded always
   - Full SKILL.md loaded on-demand
   - Reduces memory footprint

2. **Hybrid Skill Types**
   - Markdown-only for AI-reasoning tasks
   - Code-only for deterministic tasks
   - Best of both worlds

3. **DAG-Based Workflows**
   - Parallel execution where possible
   - Dependency resolution
   - Prevents infinite loops (max depth 3)

4. **Real-Time Streaming**
   - SSE for execution updates
   - Immediate feedback to users
   - Better UX than polling

5. **Extensible Tool System**
   - Skills register as tools
   - New skills add automatically
   - AI discovers them dynamically

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For MVP Scope (Weeks 1-2):
- ✅ DO: Build core skill + workflow system
- ✅ DO: Get chat streaming working
- ❌ DON'T: Add authentication
- ❌ DON'T: Implement persistence
- ❌ DON'T: Build workflow editor UI

### Security Considerations:
- All skills run in sandboxed environment
- API whitelist enforced
- Timeout limits on all executions
- Input validation on all skill invocations

### Performance Targets:
- Chat response starts <500ms
- Skill execution <30s average
- Handle 10+ concurrent users
- Stay within token budgets
