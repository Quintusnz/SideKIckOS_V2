## 🎯 Key Sections Included

### 1. Big Picture (15 lines)
```
User Message → Chat Hook (useChat) → Backend /api/agent → GPT-5 with Tools
   ↓
GPT-5 Decides Which Skill(s) to Use → Executes Skills → Streams Response

```

### 2. Architecture: Three Core Systems (85 lines)
- **Skill Registry:** Metadata-driven, lazy-loading design
- **Skills Orchestrator:** Dynamic tool registration with GPT-5
- **Workflow Engine:** DAG-based multi-step execution

### 3. Frontend Requirement (45 lines)
```typescript
// MUST use this pattern
const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, isLoading } = useChat({
  api: '/api/agent',
  maxSteps: 10,
});

// DO NOT use: Manual fetch(), WebSockets, custom chat logic
```

### 4. Development Conventions (55 lines)
- TypeScript mandatory for all `src/` code
- File naming: camelCase for utilities, PascalCase for components
- Folder structure with clear paths for each phase

### 5. Backend Streaming Pattern (30 lines)
- How SSE streaming works
- Client → Backend → Frontend flow
- Critical `.toTextStreamResponse()` requirement

### 6. Common Patterns (65 lines)
1. Parse SKILL.md files with YAML extraction
2. Lazy-load skill logic on demand
3. Convert skills to Vercel AI SDK tools
4. Build system prompts with available skills

### 7. Anti-Patterns (60 lines)
1. ❌ Don't hardcode skills
2. ❌ Don't load all logic at startup
3. ❌ Don't manually manage chat state
4. ❌ Don't forget timeouts in workflows

### 8. Development Phases (15 lines)
- Phase 1: Chat UI + Skill Registry
- Phase 2: AI Orchestration
- Phase 3: Workflow Engine
- Phase 4: Polish + Deploy

### 9. Decision Framework (20 lines)
5 key questions to ask when building something new

### 10. Pre-Submission Checklist (10 lines)
- TypeScript type safety
- SSE streaming
- useChat hook usage
- Lazy-loading patterns
- Error handling

## 📚 How to Use

### For an AI Agent
1. Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` completely
2. Reference specific sections while coding
3. Check anti-patterns before implementing
4. Use checklist before submitting code

### For a Human Developer
1. Read "Big Picture" section for context
2. Read your role-specific section (frontend/backend)
3. Reference "Common Patterns" while coding
4. Check "Anti-Patterns" for gotchas

### For a Code Reviewer
1. Use "Checklist" section for verification
2. Reference "Conventions" for style issues
3. Check "Anti-Patterns" for architectural issues
4. Validate "Frontend Requirement" (useChat) enforcement

## ✨ Why This Is Effective

### 1. **Specific to SkillsFlow AI**
- References actual files (`src/lib/skills.ts`)
- Uses real patterns from codebase (SKILL.md structure)
- Documents actual dependencies (Vercel AI SDK v5)
- Not generic advice

### 2. **Actionable for Agents**
- Clear folder structure with paths
- Code examples show correct patterns
- Anti-patterns show what NOT to do
- Checklist provides verification criteria

### 3. **Architecture-Aware**
- Explains "why" behind decisions (performance, extensibility)
- Shows data flow (client → backend → AI)
- Documents system boundaries
- References three interconnected subsystems

### 4. **Decision-Making Framework**
- 5 key questions for placement decisions
- 4 phases provide milestone context
- Conventions prevent style mismatches
- Warnings prevent common mistakes
