## 🧪 Testing Patterns & Best Practices

### Pattern 1: Mock-Based Unit Testing
```typescript
class MockWorkflowEngine {
  parseWorkflow(data) { /* mock implementation */ }
  validateWorkflow(workflow) { /* validation logic */ }
  executeWorkflow(workflow, options) { /* execution */ }
}

describe('Workflow Engine', () => {
  let engine: MockWorkflowEngine;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    engine = new MockWorkflowEngine();
  });
  
  it('should execute workflow correctly', () => {
    // Test specific functionality
  });
});
```

### Pattern 2: Integration Testing with Real Simulation
```typescript
class WorkflowExecutionEngine {
  async executeWorkflow(workflow, options) {
    // Realistic execution with callbacks, timeouts, error handling
    // Returns comprehensive execution report
  }
}

describe('Workflow Execution', () => {
  it('should execute multi-step workflow', async () => {
    const result = await engine.executeWorkflow(workflow);
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.stepsExecuted).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

### Pattern 3: Performance Monitoring
```typescript
const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor();
const end = monitor.startMeasure('operation');
// Do work
const duration = end(); // Returns duration
const stats = monitor.getStats('operation'); // Aggregated stats
```

### Pattern 4: Callback-Based Event Tracking
```typescript
await engine.executeWorkflow(workflow, {
  onStepStart: (stepId) => events.push(`start:${stepId}`),
  onStepComplete: (stepId) => events.push(`complete:${stepId}`),
  onStepFail: (stepId, error) => events.push(`fail:${stepId}`),
});
```
